## antman üêú




### Features
* koa
* webpack(support amd/CommonJS)
* sass (css extracted from js)
* uglify when build
* auto refresh(but not hot module replacement, it's a problem to be solved..)
* bundle third-party packages into vendor.js and vendor.css, so you needn't require them in your file. Third-party packages included:
    * jquery
    * bootstrap([darkly-ui](http://bootswatch.com/darkly/))
